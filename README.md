# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
## Project Description

This project is a React application that showcases upcoming events with event details displayed in card format. The application also includes contact information in the footer section. It uses CSS for styling and HTML for structuring the components.

### Features

- **Home Section**: A visually appealing home section with a dark background.

- **Upcoming Events**: Display of upcoming events with details in card format, including event dates, names, and "Learn More" buttons.

- **About Us Page**: The "About Us" page explains the concept of ASL music interpretation and its importance in making music more accessible. It also provides details on how ASL interpreters specialize in music.

- **Our Team**: The website introduces the ASL interpreters who will be providing interpretation services for specific dates. Each team member's profile includes their name, experience, and the dates they will be interpreting.

- **Footer Section**: The footer section includes contact information for the organization, allowing users to find the physical address, contact number, and email address.

- **Booking**: Users can click the "BOOK Your Ticket" button to navigate to the booking page and access the services.

### Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
